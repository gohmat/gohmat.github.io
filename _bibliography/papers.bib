  abstract={Ultracold atomic Fermi gases are the leading platform for analogue quantum simulation, and provide a promising avenue to study the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. However, current experimental approaches to cooling Fermi gases use evaporative cooling, which is limited by poor thermalisation properties of fermions and is non-number-conserving. This prevents the creation of useful analogue simulators of many collective phenomena. This thesis is the first theoretical investigation into the use of continuous-measurement feedback control as an alternative means of cooling an atomic Fermi gas. Since tractable simulation of Fermi gas dynamics requires simplifications to the full quantum field theory, we derive and simulate a fermionic equivalent to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, generalising a model of feedback-controlled BECs by Haine et al. to multimode ultracold atomic Fermi gases. We demonstrate that in the absence of measurement effects, a suitable control can drive an interacting Fermi gas arbitrarily close to its ground state. However, although control schemes based upon damping spatial density fluctuations work well for single-spatial-mode BECs, we show that they perform poorly for Fermi gases with a large number of atoms due to counter-oscillation of multiple spatial modes, which must exist due to Pauli exclusion. We generalise a feedback-measurement model of BECs by Szigeti et al. to a multimode atomic Fermi gas, and perform stochastic simulations of measured, feedback-controlled fermions in the single-atom and many-atom mean-field limits. The effects of measurement backaction are an important consideration, since in a realistic experiment knowledge of the system state used for feedback must be obtained from measurement, leading to competition between measurement-induced heating and feedback cooling.  We show that weaker and less precise measurements cool the system to a lower equilibrium excitation energy, but are unable to place practical lower bounds on measurement strength due to the lack of a system-filter separation. When measurement-induced heating is accounted for, we find that the equilibrium energy per particle scales superlinearly, suggesting that existing control schemes which work well for bosons would not be effective for fermions. In light of this, we propose several avenues of future investigation to overcome this limitation, leaving open the possibility of feedback control of atomic Fermi gases as a pathway to analogue quantum simulation.}

  abstract={An arrangement based on a degenerate cavity laser for forming an array of nonlinearly coupled lasers with an intracavity saturable absorber is presented. More than 30 lasers were spatially phase locked and temporally Q switched. The arrangement with nonlinear coupling was found to be 25 times more sensitive to loss differences and converged five times faster to the lowest loss phase locked state than with linear coupling, thus providing a unique solution to problems that have several near-degenerate solutions.},

  abstract={Degenerate quantum gases are instrumental in advancing many-body quantum physics and underpin emerging precision sensing technologies. All state-of-the-art experiments use evaporative cooling to achieve the ultracold temperatures needed for quantum degeneracy, yet evaporative cooling is extremely lossy: more than 99.9% of the gas is discarded. Such final particle number limitations constrain imaging resolution, gas lifetime, and applications leveraging macroscopic quantum coherence. Here we show that atomic Bose gases can be cooled to quantum degeneracy using real-time feedback, an entirely new method that does not suffer the same limitations as evaporative cooling. Through novel quantum-field simulations and scaling arguments, we demonstrate that an initial low-condensate-fraction thermal Bose gas can be cooled to a high-purity Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) by feedback control, with substantially lower atomic loss than evaporative cooling. Advantages of feedback cooling are found to be robust to imperfect detection, finite resolution of the control and measurement, time delay in the control loop, and spontaneous emission. Using feedback cooling to create degenerate sources with high coherence and low entropy enables new capabilities in precision measurement, atomtronics, and few- and many-body quantum physics.}

  abstract={Classical simulation of quantum dynamics plays an important role in our understanding of quantum complexity, and in the development of quantum technologies. Compared to other techniques for efficient classical simulations, methods relying on the Lie-algebraic structure of quantum dynamics have received relatively little attention. At their core, these simulations leverage the underlying Lie algebra - and the associated Lie group - of a dynamical process. As such, rather than keeping track of the individual entries of large matrices, one instead keeps track of how its algebraic decomposition changes during the evolution. When the dimension of the algebra is small (e.g., growing at most polynomially in the system size), one can leverage efficient simulation techniques. In this work, we review the basis for such methods, presenting a framework that we call "g-sim", and showcase their efficient implementation in several paradigmatic variational quantum computing tasks. Specifically, we perform Lie-algebraic simulations to train and optimize parametrized quantum circuits, design enhanced parameter initialization strategies, solve tasks of quantum circuit synthesis, and train a quantum-phase classifier.},

  abstract={Atom-interferometric quantum sensors could revolutionize navigation, civil engineering, and Earth observation. However, operation in real-world environments is challenging due to external interference, platform noise, and constraints on size, weight, and power. Here we experimentally demonstrate that tailored light pulses designed using robust control techniques mitigate significant error sources in an atom-interferometric accelerometer. To mimic the effect of unpredictable lateral platform motion, we apply laser-intensity noise that varies up to 20% from pulse-to-pulse. Our robust control solution maintains performant sensing, while the utility of conventional pulses collapses. By measuring local gravity, we show that our robust pulses preserve interferometer scale factor and improve measurement precision by 10x in the presence of this noise. We further validate these enhancements by measuring applied accelerations over a 200μg range up to 21x more precisely at the highest applied noise level. Our demonstration provides a pathway to improved atom-interferometric inertial sensing in real-world settings.},

  abstract={Simulating time evolution is one of the most natural applications of quantum computers and is thus one of the most promising prospects for achieving practical quantum advantage. Here we develop quantum algorithms to extract thermodynamic properties by estimating the density of states (DOS), a central object in quantum statistical mechanics. We introduce key innovations that significantly improve the practicality and extend the generality of previous techniques. First, our approach allows one to estimate the DOS for a specific subspace of the full Hilbert space. This is crucial for fermionic systems, since fermion-to-qubit mappings partition the full Hilbert space into subspaces of fixed number, on which both canonical and grand canonical ensemble properties depend. Second, in our approach, by time evolving very simple, random initial states (e.g. random computational basis states), we can exactly recover the DOS on average. Third, due to circuit-depth limitations, we only reconstruct the DOS up to a convolution with a Gaussian window - thus all imperfections that shift the energy levels by less than the width of the convolution window will not significantly affect the estimated DOS. For these reasons we find the approach is a promising candidate for early quantum advantage as even short-time, noisy dynamics yield a semi-quantitative reconstruction of the DOS (convolution with a broad Gaussian window), while early fault tolerant devices will likely enable higher resolution DOS reconstruction through longer time evolution. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach in representative Fermi-Hubbard and spin models and find that our approach is highly robust to algorithmic errors in the time evolution and to gate noise. We show that our approach is compatible with NISQ-friendly variational methods, introducing a new technique for variational time evolution in noisy DOS computations.},

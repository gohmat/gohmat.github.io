Hi, I'm Matt. I'm a quantum physicist, and I've just concluded a PhD in the [Quantum Technology Theory Group](https://qtechtheory.org/) at the University of Oxford. I'm a [Rhodes Scholar](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/scholarships/the-rhodes-scholarship/), and this scholarship helped support my studies and research.

My research interests span several areas of quantum technology - quantum computing, quantum sensing, quantum control, and many-body quantum dynamics.

I have recently passed my PhD viva. If you are hiring for postdocs or industry positions, please get in touch!
